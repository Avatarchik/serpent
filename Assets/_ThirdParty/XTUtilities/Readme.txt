XT Utilities v0.9b
---------------

XT Utilities is a miscellaneous set of very useful Editor utilities and components for both the Personal and Professional editions of Unity.


What's included?
---------------

* Inspector Notes: add text notes to your GameObjects. (Component > XT Utilities > Add Note) (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + N) 
* Component Selector: detects whether a drag & dropped GameObject allows for more than one selectable Component and shows a handy Component selection window.
* Package Exporter: creates an asset that will create a package automatically on double click. (Asset > Create > Package Exporter)
* Lines Of Code Counter: Counts lines in all scripts contained in the current selection or in the whole project if nothing is selected. (Tools > XT Utilities > Count Lines)
* Align Main Camera: selects and aligns the main camera to view in one step. (Component > XT Utilities > Align Main Camera) (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + .) Yes, Dot.
* Group GameObjects: groups all selected GameObjects under a new one. (GameObject > Group) (Ctrl/Cmd + G)
* Duplicate Assets: adds a context menu option to duplicate the selected assets in a smart way (i.e. duplicates scripts without compiler errors and supports for duplication of assets of different types). (Asset > Duplicate)
* Build Timer: logs to Console the time that the last build took to complete.
* Capture any Editor window as PNG file. (Tools > XT Utilities > Capture Window)
* Copy the path of an asset to clipboard. (Asset > Copy Asset Path)
* Preferences page to adjust some settings of the utilities.

XT Utilities is FREE. If you find it useful, please consider supporting me (the one man behind Xeleh Tools) by purchasing any of my other products on the Unity Asset Store:

Installation
----------

Once purchased in the Unity Asset Store and downloaded the XT Utilities package should be already installed on your system and ready to use in your projects. You just need to import the package in one of these two ways:

1) If you are creating a new project, click the "Asset packages..." button in the New Project window and mark the "XT Utilities" checkbox to get the package automatically imported.

2) If you want to import XT Utilities into an existing project, just login to the Asset Store (Window > Asset Store), toggle the Download Manager (inbox icon on the upper left corner), find the package and click on the Import button to get the package automatically imported into the current project.


Known Issues
------------

* The Component Selector won't show if you drag and drop a GameObject over a field that already contains the first selectable Component. That's because the utility needs to detect a change in your Inspector in order to start. As a workaround, please set the content of the field to None before dropping the GameObject.
