### What is this repository for? ###

This is unfinished remake of classical Snake arcade using Unity. It may provide a base for your game. **I don't develop it anymore.**

It wasn't planned for external use. There is a lot of garbage, some notes are in Russian (although all code comments are English), repository size is about 200 MB and so on. But I would better upload it as is than not at all.

You can use arbitrary mesh as a surface for snake. Collision detection with snake body isn't implemented.

### How do I get set up? ###

Clone the repo and import root folder as Unity project.

There are some diagrams in `/Doc/*.uxf`. Use [UMLet](http://www.umlet.com/) to view them.
